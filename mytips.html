      <h1>Deescalating your anxiety</h1>
      <p>
        My anxiety sneaks up on me at random times throughout the day. Some days
        it’ll be on my way to school other days it’ll be at home. In the
        beginning I found it incredibly hard to refrain from getting overwhelmed
        and panicking; however, I now use some techniques to calm myself down.

      <h1>Understand</h1>
      <p>
        Understand what a panic attack is and why it happens. A panic attack is
        a sudden onset of fear and discomfort that lasts a few minutes. Symptoms
        of a panic attack include: increased heart rate, sweating, shortness of
        breath, and trembling. Panic attacks are often caused by excessive
        stress such as job loss or the death of a loved one. Panic attacks can
        also be caused by medical conditions or traumatic events.

      <h1>Recognize</h1>
      <p>
        Recognize that you are having a panic attack. Remind yourself that the
        panic attack is not harmful, and by recognizing that you are having one
        you are taking away the fear involved. Accept that your body will take a
        few minutes to get your adrenaline back to normal and reassure yourself
        that what you are feeling is temporary and will pass.

      <h1>Take Deep Breaths</h1>
      <p>
        Hyperventilating is a symptom of anxiety and although it has been said
        over and over again, it really helps to take deep breaths and let your
        mind drift off. Focus on taking in deep breaths through your nose and
        out your mouth. While taking deep breaths, assure yourself that you are
        okay.

      <h1>Limit</h1>
      <p>
        Try to limit the consumption of coffee, cigarettes and alcohol. Any
        drink with a lot of caffeine will make you feel jittery and may
        ultimately trigger your anxiety. Cigarettes and alcohol may calm you
        down at first but later on will make you feel jittery, contributing to
        your anxiety.

      <h1>Visualize</h1>
      <p>
        Panic attacks often come from triggers that overwhelm you. Close your
        eyes and allow yourself to visualize. Picture something you love doing
        whether it’s painting in your room or riding a bike around the
        neighbourhood. This positive image will help you relax and calm down
        after getting anxious.

      <h1>Walk</h1>
      <p>
        If possible, take a walk. Sometimes when we sit in one spot for too
        long, we start to overthink. This is why a quick 5-minute walk around
        the neighbourhood can help you calm down and focus on other things like
        nature or that weird looking house you’ve never noticed before. <br />
        Controlling your anxiety takes time and practice, it will not disappear
        in one try. This is why you need to continue practicing the techniques
        that you believe work best for you in order to strengthen them and
        control your anxiety.

      <h1>3-3-3</h1>
      <p>
        Another technique I’ve found to be helpful is the common 3-3-3
        challenge. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, whether in public
        or in private, look around and name 3 objects you see, 3 sounds you hear
        and finally, move 3 of your body parts. This challenge helps you relax
        and gets your mind to slow down a bit.

      <h1>What You Eat</h1>
      <p>
        One of the most important things about your mood is your diet. What you
        eat can contribute to how you feel. Stay away from caffeine and sugary
        foods/drinks as they can affect your mood. This doesn’t mean you can’t
        have anything that contains sugar or caffeine but limit it to a small
        amount. Some healthy and nutritious options I enjoy include whole grain
        rice, fish, vegetables, fruit and eggs.

      <h1>Organize</h1>
      <p>
        Organize your thoughts. Make charts of things that worry you, for
        example a school and work schedule for the next week or the courses you
        need to take in the next year. Organizing information in a chart can
        help put your mind at ease. Organizing also helps you focus on other
        aspects of your life, giving you more free time and energy to improve
        your life in other areas.

        have proven that even slight sleep deprivation has an extensive effect
        on your mood. Not enough sleep can cause irritability and stress, while
        sleeping for at least 7 hours can enhance your mood. Create a sleep
        schedule that allows you to have around 7 hours of sleep. When getting
        ready to sleep stay away from caffeinated and sugary foods/drinks. Also
        make sure to stay away from bright lights or screens.

      <h1>Exercise</h1>
      <p>
        From experience anyone can say that exercise makes you feel good. The
        reason why you should start exercising regularly is that exercise
        actually increases your level of endorphins. Endorphins are natural mood
        lifters. Exercise can also help improve your mood by getting your sleep
        patterns back to normal. Regularly exercising can also reduce stress and
        symptoms of mental health conditions like depression and anxiety.

      <h1>Writing</h1>

        Writing is a great way to improve your mood and mental health. Get a
        journal for writing down your thoughts and feelings. Writing down your
        thoughts and feelings helps you gain control of your emotions while
        improving your mental health. If you struggle with stress, depression,
        or anxiety, writing in a journal is a good way to alleviate some of
        those feelings by understanding them more clearly.

      <h1>Take a bath</h1>
      <p>
        Many people claim that taking a hot bath helps improve their mood but is
        it true? Studies show that heating up your body assists in muscle
        relaxation which in return boosts your mood. Researchers at the
        University of Freiburg in Germany discovered that by regularly
        increasing people’s body temperatures they were able to improve their
        internal clock which resulted in lessening some of their depression
        symptoms. From experience, a hot bath has always made me calm down and
        has helped my chest feel lighter. <br />

      <h1>Reframing The Way You Think</h1>
      <p>
        Our perception of the control we have in our lives can affect our
        ability to cope. When you feel yourself getting overwhelmed by your
        thoughts try to reframe them. Instead of thinking “I am always going to
        fail” try reframing to “this wasn’t my best attempt but there is always
        another chance”. Remind yourself that everyday there is a new
        opportunity to try again.
