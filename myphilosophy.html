              Not so much of a shocker; but living with depression is not easy.
              It is very lonely and sometimes gets you into trouble. Growing up
              I was taught that having a mental illness was not something to
              display, mostly by my peers but also by my family. I felt like I
              was really different and odd. I always wished that someone would
              come into my life and reassure me about how I was feeling. Looking
              back at my experiences the only part that I wish had been
              different was having someone to talk about my feelings with. ​<br /><br />
              I created this website because I want to help others who feel the
              same way I did, to me having someone to talk to would have made
              dealing with my mental health issues less lonely. I would like to
              start the conversation about using support groups to assist with
              mental illness. It is a universal thought that the only way to
              support someone dealing with a mental illness is by seeking
              professional help. This may be true in some aspects; however, the
              use of support groups and discussion circles can help those who
              are not ready to seek out professional help by allowing them to
              understand their feelings and to know that they are not alone in
              their battles.
              <br />

              So welcome to my circle, feel free to stay a while &#128522;
