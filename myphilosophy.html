              Not so much of a shocker; but living with depression is not easy.
              It is very lonely and sometimes gets you into trouble. Growing up
              I was taught that having a mental illness was not something to
              display, mostly by my peers but also by my family. I felt like an
              outsider that wanted to be let in. I always thought to myself I
              wish I had someone to talk to, someone to tell me that it'll all
              be okay and that it was okay to be different. Looking back at my
              experiences the only thing that I wish had been different was
              having someone to talk to. ​<br /><br />
              I created this website because I want to help others who felt the
              same way I did, because to me having someone to talk to would have
              made dealing with my mental health issues a bit less lonely. I
              also hope to raise awareness about mental illness and to hopefully
              someday be able to host in-person meetings. <br />
              <br />
              So welcome to my bubble, feel free to stay a while.
